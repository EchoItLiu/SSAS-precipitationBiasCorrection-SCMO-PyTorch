# SSAS-precipitationBiasCorrection-SCMO-PyTorch
We develop a novel deep-learning model for postprocessing the precipitation numerical forecasting called Spatiotemporal Scale Adaptive Selection.
The open source of our SSAS will be uploaded successively and corresponding datasets (including the intermediate files) will be public. (ranging from Jan 1st to Jan 15th, 2021)
